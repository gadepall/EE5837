Simulation of Multipath Fading Channels: Improvements of Jakeâ€™s Simulator

In this repository it is possible to find the semestral project for the course of "Wireless Communications" 
taken in University of Padova during the accademic year 2016/2017. 


DESCRIPTION: Matlab realization of several Simulators for Rayleigh and Rician channel. 



HOW TO USE THE CODE: - open on of the two folders: "Rician" or "Rayleigh" 
                     -  run "main.m" to start the simulation
